Subject: Don't check the status field of the OpenSSL version

There is no reason to check the version of OpenSSL (in Debian).  If it's
not compatible the soname will change.  OpenSSH seems to want to do a
check for the soname based on the version number, but wants to keep the
status of the release the same.  Remove that check on the status since
it doesn't tell you anything about how compatible that version is.
