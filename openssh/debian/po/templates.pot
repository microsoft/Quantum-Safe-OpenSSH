"Previous versions of openssh-server permitted logging in as root over SSH "
"using password authentication. The default for new installations is now "
"\"PermitRootLogin prohibit-password\", which disables password "
"authentication for root without breaking systems that have explicitly "
"configured SSH public key authentication for root."

"This change makes systems more secure against brute-force password "
"dictionary attacks on the root user (a very common target for such attacks). "
"However, it may break systems that are set up with the expectation of being "
"able to SSH as root using password authentication. You should only make this "
"change if you do not need to do that."
